# Stock Price Forecasting

### Data Overview:
The dataset primarily revolves around a company's stock prices, with the "Last Traded Price" (LTP) column representing the daily closing prices. Additional columns encompass various stock market indicators and financial metrics, although specific details on these columns were not discussed.

### Key Objectives:

1. **Analyzing Price Trends:** Visualized the historical stock price trends to comprehend the stock's historical movements and trajectories.

2. **Assessing Volatility:** Calculated daily returns to pinpoint periods of heightened stock price fluctuations and volatility.

3. **Predictive Modeling:** Leveraged historical stock data and associated metrics to create predictive models for forecasting future stock prices. Employed Random Forest for classification, predicting price movements, and regression, predicting exact prices.

4. **Feature Importance:** Utilized Random Forest's feature importance to determine the most influential factors in forecasting stock price movements.

5. **Stock Movement Clustering:** Implemented K-means clustering to group stock price movements, aiding in the identification of typical and volatile trading days.

### Outcomes:

1. **Stock Price Visualization:** Generated visualizations of stock price changes over time, providing insights into the company's stock performance.

2. **Predictive Modeling:** Achieved a classification model accuracy of XX% in predicting stock price directions. Utilized evaluation metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for the regression model.

3. **Feature Importance:** Identified key features that significantly influence stock price predictions.

4. **K-means Clustering:** Grouped stock price movements based on daily returns, revealing potential clusters that can assist in risk assessment and trading strategy development.
